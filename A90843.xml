            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In all which, we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a condition put upon the Creature, but God hath engaged himſelf to do the whole work for them.</p>
            <p>The fourth Difference is in regard of the Promiſes of theſe<note place="margin">Fourth difference is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</note> Covenants; the Promiſes of the firſt Covenant being onely Temporall Promiſes, of Temporall things: as Deut. 28. verſ. 1. to the 15.

Jerem. 31. 32, 33, 24. As in one, there is no mention of a Spirituall Promiſe; ſo in the other there is no mention of a Temporall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>The fifth Difference is between the Mediators of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants;<note place="margin">Fifth Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is between the Medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ators of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</note> the firſt being (as I conceive) <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore he is ſaid to be faithfull in all his houſe, Heb. 3. 2. 5. Gal 3. 19. and we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> performing the office of a mediator, as neede did require, as Exo. 32. 11. <hi>Let me alone ſaith God that I may deſtroy them;</hi> but <hi>Moſes would not give over God till he was appeaſed;</hi> as verſe 14. and Pſal. 106. 23. But the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the new Covenant is Jeſus Chriſt, Heb. 8. 6. and 9.<note place="margin">Sixth Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in the Blood of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</note> 15. It is Chriſt alone that is the Mediator between God and man with referance to the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>The ſixt difference is in the Bloods of the two Covenants, one was the blood of Calves and goates (to wit, of the firſt covenant) as Heb. 9 19 20. Where it is called <hi>the blood of the Covenant;</hi> ſo alſo, Exod. 24. 8. But the blood of the New<note place="margin">Seventh difference is in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Law of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</note> Covenant is the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Who through the Eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath offred up himſelf without ſpot to God;</hi> ſo alſo, cor. 11. 25</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Difference is in the writing of the Law of the covenants; the firſt was written in Tables of Stone, Exod. 32. 15, 16. But the Law of the New Covenant was written in the heart, as Heb. 8. 10. 1 cor. 11. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113589:5"/>The Eighth difference, is in regard of the obſcurity of the<note place="margin">8 Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in regard of the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the one, and plainneſſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> one, and plainneſſe of the other, as in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. there was blackneſſe and darkneſſe at the delivery of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. but the New Covenant is plain and clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and it muſt needs be ſo, ſeeing the law of it is written in the heart of the people; The people of the firſt, could not look to the end of that which is aboliſhed, and this obſcurity was ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the <hi>veile upon Moſes face, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 13. therefore this vail is ſaid <hi>to remain upon their face untill this day in the reading of the Old Testament,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>but we with open face behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory; as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> verſ. 18.</p>
            <p>The Ninth difference, is in regard of the worſhip that did<note place="margin">9 Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in regard of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</note> appertain to theſe Covenants; for that which did belong to the firſt Covenant, did conſiſt of tipes and ſhadowes of good things to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
            <p>But the worſhip under this Covenant, is ſuch a worſhip as declares that thoſe good things are already come, and is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worſhip, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 23. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>The laſt difference that I ſhall name, is, that <hi>The firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, the 1 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is done away that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond might be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> 
               <hi>is done away, that the ſecond might be eſtabliſhed, 2 Cor. 3. 11. Heb.</hi> 8. 13. and 10. 9.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly ſhewed the differences between the two Covenants: But it may be ſome will object and ſay, what is this to the laying open the main root of <hi>Antichriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that in regard the firſt Covenant did run in the fleſh, and did hold out Chriſt to come in the fleſh; Now to hold out that Covenant when Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is the main Root of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and denyes Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come in the fleſh: As will more evidently appear by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over theſe particulars again, and making ſuch uſe thereof, as the Scripture will direct us to do.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The uſe of the firſt Difference.</head>
               <p>If the firſt Covenant was made when God took the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the hand to lead them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:113589:6"/>
then it takes off that which ſome ſuppoſe, that all actuall ſinnes are ſinnes againſt the firſt Covenant, and are done away by Chriſt, and that unbeleife is onely the ſinne againſt the New Covenant; to this end they bring that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. where it is ſaid, <hi>for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death, for the Redemption of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called, might retain the promiſe of eternall Inheritance:</hi> Now to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the whole ſcope of that place is to ſhew, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there were ſacrifices offered for ſinne according to the Law, yet it was not ſufficient to do away ſin; for there was an inſufficiency in them, as appeares <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 3, 4, 11. and chap. 9. 9. ſee alſo the following verſes to the 15. verſe; alſo chap. 10. 1. All which ſheweth, that that Covenant, and thoſe ſacrifices could not make perfect, nor doe away ſinne, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſcience, but that the bloud of Chriſt muſt doe it, and that they muſt look beyond all thoſe things to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9, 10, 12. chap. 9. 14, 26, 28.</p>
               <p>Again, this Covenant being made at that time, declares, that other people were not priviledged with that Covenant, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. It is moſt evident that God took no people into Covenant before he took the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for there was no people in a Religious communion, untill God gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Promiſes, and the tipes of the Covenants, as may be found by the Scriptures: Therefore to hold that all actuall ſinne, that hath been, or ſhall be committed by men of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſinnes againſt the firſt Covenant, and done away by Chriſt, makes the firſt Covenant to be made to all Nations, which is contrary to <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 147. 19, 20. Again, it makes the Covenant to be before it was: Again, it holds it out to be ſtill in being to the end of the world, whereas the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be done away: as before ſhewed.</p>

               <p>If the firſt Covenant was made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, and the ſecond with <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit; Then to affirme
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113589:6"/>
that <hi>Infants are foederally holy by vertue of their being borne of Beleeving Parents,</hi> holds forth ſtill a Covenant in the Fleſh, which to do, doth (to my underſtanding) deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh; for if the Teſtator of the New Teſtament be dead, and the New Teſtament be in force onely to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Seed, then to bring in the <hi>Naturall</hi> Seed again, is to looke for Chriſt to come again, for he was to come of the <hi>Naturall</hi> Seed, and when he is come, all the priviledges that came by diſcent, are void; as appeares by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. where the Apoſtle renounces all fleſhly priviledges, and thoſe he ſtrives for, are ſuch as flow from Chriſts ſufferings, death, and reſurrection; as alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. After the Apoſtle had ſpoken of the death of Chriſt, in the 15. verſe; he infers (verſ. 16.) <hi>that henceforth we know no man after the fleſh, though we have known Christ after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him ſo no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ask what holineſſe that is in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that we are to mind the ſcope of the place; the Apoſtle is there <hi>anſwering</hi> a doubt, which was, <hi>whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving husband, or wife, might continue to dwell with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife being an unbeleiver?</hi> He anſwers, they might, or elſe their children would be unclean, as they were under the Law or firſt Covenant; but that was a thing out of queſtion; it ſeems they did not queſtion but they might keep their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But it appears by the Apoſtle they might, as wel queſtion the one, as the other; but neither was to be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome may object and ſay, that the people that came of <hi>Jacob</hi> were not the Seed of the Fleſh, but <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was the Seed of the Fleſh, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29.</p>
               <p>For anſwer hereunto, the Seed of the Fleſh is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Two-fold reſpect: Firſt, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was the Seed of the Fleſh, for he was by a Bond woman, and was begotten in the ſtrength of Nature; and ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not the Seed of the fleſh, for he was of the Free-woman, and born by promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23. Again, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was the Seed of the fleſhy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 11, 12. as he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

he was before <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for the Bond-woman did type out the firſt Covenant, and her Seed did type out the Seed of the firſt Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23, 24 But <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a type, did hold forth the Seed of the New Covenant as <hi>Sarah</hi> did (as a type) hold forth the New Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26, 27, 28. and therefore the mighty Power of God was ſeen, to make good his promiſe above and beyond the power and ſtrength of Nature, to cauſe <hi>Sarah</hi> to conceive, and bring forth <hi>Iſaac;</hi> even as it is the mighty power of God above the ſtrength of nature, that cauſes the children of the new Covenant to be brought forth, <hi>Iohn 2. 5. Epheſ. 2. 5, 6. Coloſ. 1. 12, 13 14. 1 Pet. 1. 3. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 24. Therefore let us learn to put a difference, where the Scripture puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, leaſt we deny Chriſt to become in the Fleſh, and ſo be antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>If any object and ſay, May not Infants be the children of the New Covenants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Not by vertue of being deſcended of <hi>Believing Parents,</hi> as is pleaded from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.</p>
               <p>Again, let this teach all <hi>Beleevers,</hi> to love as <hi>Brethren;</hi> Be not like thoſe <hi>Iſraelites, Exe.</hi> 2. 13.

Oh therefore, let there be no ſtrangeneſſe amongſt us; God our Father loves us, and bears with us; let us learn to do the like one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: It is not the taking, or not taking up of an Ordinance that makes us the children of God, but our being in covenant with God, and there may be as much tenderneſſe of the Glory of God ſhewed, in the forbearing to practice that which we are not ſatisfied in, as in practiſing that which we are ſatisfied in. <hi>Let us not therefore judg one another any more,</hi> Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113589:7"/>
wherewith one may edifie another,</hi> (verſ. 19.) And <hi>judge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the hearts: and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Corinth. 4. 5. Love is a great duty, that the people of the New Covenant owe one to another, Heb. 10. 24. and that which Chriſt requireth of them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 34. and it is a Note to know Chriſts Diſciples, from the World, verſ. 35. I his makes us like God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4: 7, 8, 11, 12. I might write a whole Book of this particular; But I hope thoſe to whom this is directed, will be active in the diſcharge of this duty; and truly I obſerve, that of late the people of God are more for love, and the ſilencing of differences, then ever I knew them; which I doubt not, but it is a preſage of much good: but I ſay no more of this, leſt it ſhould ſeeme to be a degreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Again, by this it appeares, that to hold a Nation (as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.) to be the Church of God in Covenant, denies Chriſt to become in the fleſh, and ſo is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; For if a <hi>Nation</hi> be in <hi>Covenant,</hi> it muſt needs be in the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>New Covenant</hi> takes a choiſe people out of the Nations in <hi>whoſe hearts God writes his Law, Heb. 8. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 3. and they ſhall all know him from the least to the greateſt,</hi> (verſ. 11.) But ſo it cannot be ſaid of any Nation; <hi>&amp; he will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſſe, and their ſin, and their iniquities he will remember no more.</hi> But to what Nation can this be apply'd? Surely to none, but to a ſelect people; and therefore the Churches of Chriſt under this Covenant, are ſaid to be <hi>in Chriſt, Gal. 1. 22. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. In which places take notice, that even in <hi>Judea</hi> where was onely <hi>one Church;</hi> which was the collective body of the <hi>Nation,</hi> none excepted under the <hi>firſt Covenant;</hi> now under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> there is ſeverall Churches which are in Chriſt.</p>

               <head>The uſe of the Ninth Difference.</head>
               <p>If the worſhip of the firſt Covenant did hold out Chriſt to come, and the worſhip of the New-covenant declares Chriſt to be already come; Then it teaches us, that to hold out any part of that worſhip now, is to deny Chriſt to be come, and ſo is <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the worſhips of the two Covenants, did differ in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regards; As firſt, the worſhip of the firſt Covenant was tied to <hi>one Nation,</hi> Pſal. 147. 19. 20. Alſo, it was tied to <hi>one place,</hi> Deut. 25. 5, 6, 7 14. 26, 27. But the worſhip of the New-covenant is to be performed in <hi>any Nation,</hi> and in <hi>any place</hi> of that Nation, Acts 10. 34, 3. Epheſs. the 2. to the end of the Chapter, Joh. 4. 21, 22, 23. Anſwerable to this was the Saints practice, Acts 2. 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. 14. 23. <hi>When the whole Church is come together into ſome place</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) making no difference of places. The worſhip of the firſt Covenant was <hi>carnall,</hi> and performed in a worldly ſanctuary, Col. 2. 10. 20. Heb. 9. 1. But the worſhip of the New-covenant is <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and performed in a Spirituall Sanctuary, Phil. 3. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Epheſ. 2. 20. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, it will eaſily appear what is the reaſon that many of the people of God, do queſtion many things in point of worſhip: As firſt of all, that all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Nation ſhould be compelled to worſhip; for though God did require under the firſt covenant that the <hi>whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Iſrael ſhould worſhip him, it was becauſe they were his people in covenant; but he hath not taken any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into covenant; therefore to force any Nation to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, muſt have a ground from the firſt covenant; But in the New-covenant God onely requires ſuch to worſhip him, as can <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and truth,</hi> Joh. 4. 23. This makes many think, that if it would pleaſe the Magiſtrates to ſet men free
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113589:14"/>
in point of worſhip, there would be more ſincerity, and leſſe hypocriſie in the worſhip of God; As to inſtance in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Faſts, the whole Nation is forced to worſhip, as the Nation of Iſrael was; But now under the New-covenant God requiring onely <hi>Spirituall worſhip,</hi> it is conceived, that if all thoſe who have <hi>no heart,</hi> nor <hi>no ſpirituall ability</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form worſhip, were left to follow their buſineſſe in the world, which they can do, and the work were commended onely to thoſe that would freely offer themſelves, it would be more pleaſing to God, being more ſutable to the New-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and leſſe ſutable to the Old; for it is not the number, but the ſinceritie in anſwering a Rule of the New-covenant that is well pleaſing to God: Three horſes that can, and will draw, will do more when the Cart ſtands, then they can with twenty more added to them that draw backward: The like may be ſaid of other Nationall worſhip.</p>
               <p>Again, inaſmuch as God did binde all the people of the firſt covenant to come to one place to worſhip, and to bring thither their guift, which place he made holy by dedication, and conſecration; and now a ground being taken from thence to ſet apart ſpeciall places of worſhip, conſecrated, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and all men bound unto it under penalties, as in the firſt covenant; that therefore it is, that many of the people of the New-covenant are afraid to come to worſhip there,<note place="margin">

                  <label>Objection.</label> But if you ſay, ſometime they had none to rule by that

               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label> I anſwer, though they had none to rule, yet there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the Scepter, and the right of ruling; and that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of worſhip, God informing them by his Prophets what to do, they being to rule for him, in that Nation which he had choſen, which was Church and State individuall; and this to continue till Shilo came; therefore when this people would have a King like other Nations (God having differenced them from all other Nations) God tels the Prophet, <hi>they had not caſt off him, but God:</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. And though God did grant them a King, yet would he not make them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like other Nations; for he would chuſe their King for them, 1 Sam. 10. 24. And he appointed the manner of their Kingdome, verſ. 25. Thus did God rule over the people of His Covenant, in a more eſpeciall way then over other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore it is conceived, that he doth ſo now over the people of the New-covenant; But now Shilo is come, he is<note place="margin">Ioh 1. 49 Rev. 1. 5. and 15. 3. Mat. 2. 2 &amp; 21. 5.</note> conceived to have the Scepter, and to be the Law-giver to the people of the New-covenant, in all thoſe things that appertain to his own Kingdome; and for thoſe things that appertain to this life, he hath ſet the Ordinance of Magiſtracy to be obeyed, by all his own people, as well as others, and he that reſiſteth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1 2, 5.</note> reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and therefore they muſt obey, or ſubmit to every humane ordinance, or <hi>ordinance of man for</hi>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label> I anſwer, ſeeing God by his own Ordinance hath appointed Magiſtrates to order the affairs of the Nations, and Jeſus Chriſt to order the affairs of his Kingdome, this objection is

fully reſolved: Neither need any fear that any of thoſe that have learned to give the Lord his due, will deny <hi>Caeſar</hi> his, ſeeing the Lord hath made both a duty; and both former, and latter, experience doth confirm it; and if any men in the Kingdome be diſloyall to the Magiſtrates, it is thoſe that would ſo fain have thoſe that are faithfull and true hearted to the State cut off, impriſoned, or baniſhed, in a time when there is ſo great need of them: But the Lord forgive them.</p>

               <p>If the Lord have taken away the firſt, that he might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſecond, Heb. 10. 9. Then it ſhould teach all people to take heed that they do not go about to eſtabliſh again that which God hath taken away, nor take away that which God hath eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as all do which endeavour to bring into the worſhip of God the rites of the firſt Covenant; and it is indeed to give the ſpirit of God the lye, for it is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſay the firſt Covenant is beſt, when the ſpirit of God ſayes the ſecond is the beſt, being eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</p>
               <p>I am perſwaded, that each godly heart doth long for the utter ruine of Antichriſt, which will be completed ſo ſoon as this is generally ſeen, that the upholding the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is the upholding of Antichriſt; what was that with which the Churches were deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bewitched preſently upon their firſt planting? Was it not the bringing in ſome thing of the firſt Covenant? As appears, Gal. 3. 1, 2, 3. and almoſt the whole Epiſtle declares it. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucified among you?</hi> The Apoſtle ſeems to admire that inaſmuch as a crucified Chriſt had been ſo cleerly held forth among them, which did put an end to the Rites of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113589:15"/>
firſt Covenant, that they ſhould be ſo bewitched as to bring them in again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are you ſo fooliſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having begun in the ſpirit, are you now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> Verſ. 3. By <hi>fleſh</hi> he means the rites and priviledges of the firſt Covenant, and by <hi>ſpirit</hi> the priviledges of the ſecond, as appears by what followes all along, to the 12. verſe of the fifth Chapter; compared with Phil. 3. 3, 4. If the <hi>Galatians</hi> were bewitched, and if it were fooliſhneſſe in them to return to the firſt Covenant; is it not ſo now in thoſe that do the ſame thing, as they did? Would it make the Apoſtle <hi>a tranſgreſſour to build again the things which he had deſtroyed?</hi> Gal. 2. 18. And muſt not they needs be tranſgreſſours, which build again the things which God himſelf hath made void, Heb. 10. 9.

You ſee he holds out the diſtance and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Liberty of the New-covenant, and the bondage of the Old, in the two Mothers, and their two Seeds; as before is ſhewed. Gal. 4. 22. 24 25. 26. Again, he tels them, <hi>If they were circumciſed Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing,</hi> Gal. 5. 2. That <hi>Chriſt was become of none effect to them,</hi> that <hi>they were debters to keep the whole Law;</hi> that <hi>they were faln from grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that Circumciſion was that particular of the firſt Covenant, whereby they were moſt eaſily deceived at that time, being ſo lately in uſe: But now this will not take with people, the ſpirit of Antichriſt hath put men upon the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of other particulars of the firſt Covenant, which are as dangerous (as I conceive) as that of Circumciſion: Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take heed how we act in any of the parts of the firſt Covenant, in the worſhip of God; <hi>for the perſwaſion</hi>

ſo to act <hi>is not of him that calleth us,</hi> Gal. 5. 8. Religion is not a thing to be jeſted with; If we would therefore honour God, and be honoured of God in the enjoyment of Goſpel freedome, and perſue Antichriſt to his utter ruine; Let us cleave cloſe to the rules which Chriſt, and his Apoſtles have left us to walk by, which when all religious people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are brought unto, Antichriſt is down.</p>
